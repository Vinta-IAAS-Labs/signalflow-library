The `workflow_requests` submodule of `apm` facilitates the creation of request rate detectors for workflows. Basically it supplies `'workflow'` for the keyword argument `resource_type` in several places, which replaces the `spans` metric with its `workflows` counterpart (see [apm/utils](../utils.flow) for details).

For more detailed documentation see the [requests](../../apm/requests/README.md) module, in particular the [static threshold](../../apm/requests/static_v2/README.md), [sudden change](../../apm/requests/sudden_change_v2/README.md), and [historical anomaly](../../apm/requests/historical_anomaly_v2/README.md) alerts.
